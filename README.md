# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Overview

This repository contains a Multiple Disease Prediction System that predicts three common diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. The system takes input values from the user and uses machine learning models to provide predictions for each disease.

## Features
User-friendly Interface: The system provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input relevant values for prediction.

Multiple Disease Prediction: The system is capable of predicting three different diseases—diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease—based on the provided user input.

Machine Learning Models: Advanced machine learning models are employed for disease prediction, ensuring accurate and reliable results.

## Usage

### To use the Multiple Disease Prediction System, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
    git clone https://github.com/AmanBharti0102/Multiple-Disease-Predictor.git
### Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the Application:

python `main.py`

This will launch the application, and you can interact with it through the command line or a graphical user interface.

Input Values:
Enter the required values when prompted by the system. These values may include age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., depending on the disease being predicted.

View Results:
The system will provide predictions for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease based on the input values.

### Supported Diseases
